# Perturbed-Satellite-Motion--Numerical-Integration
The provided information seems to pertain to orbital mechanics rather than respiratory systems. Here's a breakdown of the steps assuming you have the basic code structure from the previous Kepler problem:
# Satellite Orbit Simulation Repository

## Description
This repository contains MATLAB scripts for numerically simulating the orbit of a satellite, such as CHAMP, considering Earth's oblateness (J2 term) as a perturbation. Additionally, it includes a simplified model for atmospheric drag and tools for comparing numerical and analytical solutions of the perturbed orbit.

## Contents

### 1. Perturbed Orbit with J2 Term
#### 1.1. kepler_eom.m
- Modified Equations of Motion incorporating perturbations due to Earth's oblateness.
#### 1.2. compare_orbits.m
- MATLAB script to compare the perturbed numerical solution with the analytical solution.

### 2. Atmospheric Drag (Simplified Model)
#### 2.1. atmospheric_drag.m
- MATLAB function for calculating the drag force acting on the satellite.
#### 2.2. kepler_eom.m
- Modified Equations of Motion including the effect of atmospheric drag.
#### 2.3. compare_orbits.m
- MATLAB script to plot the satellite's height above Earth's surface over time, considering atmospheric drag.

### 3. Orbital Perturbation Due to Atmosphere (Future Implementation)
This section outlines steps for analyzing the impact of the atmosphere on the satellite's orbit height after three revolutions.
